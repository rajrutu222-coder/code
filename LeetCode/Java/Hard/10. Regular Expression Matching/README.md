### 📜 Problem Description

Given an input string  `s`  and a pattern  `p` , implement regular expression matching with support for  `'.'`  and  `'*'`  where:

	
- `'.'`  Matches any single character.​​​​
	
- `'*'`  Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

Return a boolean indicating whether the matching covers the entire input string (not partial).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "aa", p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "aa", p = "a*"
Output: true
Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "ab", p = ".*"
Output: true
Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".

```

**Constraints:**

	
- `1 <= s.length <= 20`
	
- `1 <= p.length <= 20`
	
- `s`  contains only lowercase English letters.
	
- `p`  contains only lowercase English letters,  `'.'` , and  `'*'` .
	
- It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character  `'*'` , there will be a previous valid character to match.
